# Overview of App

You wake up in the morning and take a shower. You go to your closet and get dressed. You realize you’re wearing the same outfit as last week. What an issue! If only there was an app that could save you from being in groundhog’s day. Oh wait there is! Thanks to our handy dandy new application, users are able to gain inspirations on what to wear. Date night? Business meeting? Casual loungewear? With a quick search through our wide selection of outfits and you’re saved from meeting your boss in that dress you wore to the club last Thursday. Why wear the same clothes over and over when you can wow everyone with your fashionable taste.
